# Rotate Matrix: Given an image represented by an NxN matrix, where each pixel in the image is 4
# bytes, write a method to rotate the image by 90 degrees. Can you do this in place?

# extra constraints
# make this with no extra memory: in place.

def rotate_matrix(matrix: list) -> list:
    # rotate a matrix in 90 degrees
    rows = columns = len(matrix)
    pass
